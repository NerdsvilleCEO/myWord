<i>An easy open source way to create nice-looking web pages for essays.</i>



I have a new writing tool I'm working on and wanted it to be able to create beautiful essay pages like Medium. But Medium doesn't have an API. So I made an essay-viewer that does. ;-)

Now, I'm not a great CSS hacker. That's obvious. But all that's needed is a framework to get started. That's the idea.

I'm going to iterate over it a bit before going public with it.

Thought you might get a kick...
